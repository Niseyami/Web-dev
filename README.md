# Web-dev
This is a repository to contain all the code/projects that I have/will complete in a Y10 IT (Web development class)

Some details about the whole thing:\n
Running a (really) small local http server with node.js.\n
Sass is being used to compile css so the end product is really small.\n
Bootstrap makes everything look nice so I am also using that\n
Probably will use some kind of js minifier aswell in the future\n
